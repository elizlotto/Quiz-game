/////////////////////////
// THE ISSUES:        //
// ////////////////////

//we wanted to make this game multi-player but found this to be problematic for a few reasons: physically this would be strange. Does the other player turn away when player 1 is answering questions? How do we make a game played on the same screen be cheat proof?
//What kind of code would we implement to switch between players after each turn? Is two days with limited availability enough to brain storm and debug that kind of code?
//Wanted to display a scoreboard at the end of each playthrough 
//We tried randomizing the questions and had success in a separate file but couldn't get the code to run in our project file.
//fun fact: Frank wrote the function that would accept an object as an argument. We couldn't sync up our times to code together, but we noticed how the code was written and added a prompt asking the user what types of questions they'd like to answer, with their answer determining the object passed into the function. It turns out, this was Frank's intention and we figured that out by reading his code. 


//STRETCH POSSIBILITIES
// - add functionality for multiple players, with a scoreboard
// - combine functionality for true/false and multiple choice questions so that the question set could be mixed and matched.
